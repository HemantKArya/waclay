## 📖 About This Project

**waclay** (WebAssembly Component Layer) is a **runtime-agnostic** implementation of the [WebAssembly Component Model](https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model). This project enables you to load, link, and execute WASM components with full component model support across **any** WebAssembly runtime backend.

### 🎯 Why This Fork?

This is a **maintained fork** of the original `wasm_component_layer` project. After the original developer discontinued active maintenance, the project became difficult to compile and use with modern Rust toolchains. This fork aims to:

- ✅ **Keep it compiling** - Updated to work with latest Rust and dependencies (50+ commits of fixes and improvements)
- ✅ **Add new features** - Including the new `wit-bindgen-wcl` tool for generating host bindings
- ✅ **Maintain usability** - Making it a practical tool for plugin development and WASM-based applications
- ✅ **Stay runtime agnostic** - Preserving the brilliant design that works with Wasmi, Wasmtime, and other backends
- ✅ **Build community** - Active development and welcoming contributions until Component Model standardization

### 💡 The Brilliant Design

The original author's vision of a **runtime-agnostic component layer** combined with the **wasm_runtime_layer** abstraction is truly innovative. This design allows you to:

- Switch between different WASM runtimes (Wasmi, Wasmtime, etc.) without changing your code
- Use the same Component Model API regardless of the underlying execution engine
- Build portable WASM applications that work across multiple platforms and backends

This architecture is **essential** for the WASM ecosystem as we wait for the Component Model to be finalized and fully supported across all runtimes.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Install Rust (if not already installed)
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# Install wasm-tools for building components
cargo install wasm-tools
```

### Installation
```bash
cargo build
```

### Installation

#### Option 1: Use in Your Project (Recommended)

Add to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
waclay = { git = "https://github.com/HemantKArya/waclay" }
# Choose your runtime backend
wasmi_runtime_layer = "0.51.0"
# OR
# wasmtime_runtime_layer = "21.0.0"
```

> **Note:** Not yet published to crates.io - may be published in the future. Use git dependency for now.

**Optional: Install wit-bindgen-wcl for generating bindings**

If you want to generate host bindings from WIT files:

```bash
# Install the binding generator tool globally
cargo install --git https://github.com/HemantKArya/waclay wit-bindgen-wcl

# Now you can use it
wit-bindgen-wcl ./path/to/wit ./bindings.rs
```

#### Option 2: Build from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HemantKArya/waclay.git
cd waclay

# Build the workspace
cargo build --release

# Install the binding generator
cargo install --path crates/wit-bindgen-wcl
```

### Basic Usage Example

### Basic Usage Example

Here's a simple example of loading and calling a WASM component:

**1. Define your WIT interface** (`guest.wit`)
**1. Define your WIT interface** (`guest.wit`)

```wit
package test:guest

interface foo {
    // Selects the item in position n within list x
    select-nth: func(x: list<string>, n: u32) -> string
}

world guest {
    export foo
}
```

**2. Load and call the component** (Rust host code)

```rust
use waclay::*;

// The bytes of the component.
const WASM: &[u8] = include_bytes!("single_component/component.wasm");

pub fn main() {
    // Create a new engine for instantiating a component.
    let engine = Engine::new(wasmi_runtime_layer::Engine::default());

    // Create a store for managing WASM data and any custom user-defined state.
    let mut store = Store::new(&engine, ());

    // Parse the component bytes and load its imports and exports.
    let component = Component::new(&engine, WASM).unwrap();
    // Create a linker that will be used to resolve the component's imports, if any.
    let linker = Linker::default();
    // Create an instance of the component using the linker.
    let instance = linker.instantiate(&mut store, &component).unwrap();

    // Get the interface that the interface exports.
    let interface = instance.exports().instance(&"test:guest/foo".try_into().unwrap()).unwrap();
    // Get the function for selecting a list element.
    let select_nth = interface.func("select-nth").unwrap().typed::<(Vec<String>, u32), String>().unwrap();

    // Create an example list to test upon.
    let example = ["a", "b", "c"].iter().map(ToString::to_string).collect::<Vec<_>>();

    println!("Calling select-nth({example:?}, 1) == {}", select_nth.call(&mut store, (example.clone(), 1)).unwrap());
    // Prints 'Calling select-nth(["a", "b", "c"], 1) == b'
}
```

That's it! You've successfully loaded and executed a WebAssembly component. 🎉

### Using wit-bindgen-wcl for Better Ergonomics

Generate type-safe bindings from WIT files:

```bash
# Generate bindings from WIT directory
wit-bindgen-wcl ./path/to/wit ./bindings.rs

# Use in your code
cargo run --bin wit-bindgen-wcl -- ./guest.wit ./bindings.rs
```

Then use the generated bindings for type-safe, ergonomic API:

```rust
mod bindings;
use bindings::*;  // Type-safe functions generated from WIT

// Much more ergonomic than raw Value manipulation!
```

## 🎯 How It Works

### The Runtime Agnostic Architecture

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│           Your Application                  │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│         waclay (Component Layer)            │
│  • Component Model Implementation           │
│  • Type System & Lifting/Lowering           │
│  • Resource Management                      │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│    wasm_runtime_layer (Abstraction)         │
│  • Common Runtime Interface                 │
│  • Backend Agnostic API                     │
├──────────┬──────────┬──────────┬────────────┤
│  Wasmi   │ Wasmtime │  Wasmer  │  Browser   │
│ Runtime  │  Runtime │  Runtime │   (JS)     │
└──────────┴──────────┴──────────┴────────────┘
```

**Key Benefits:**

1. **Write once, run anywhere** - Your code works with any runtime
2. **Easy runtime switching** - Change one line to switch backends
3. **Future-proof** - As new runtimes emerge, they just work
4. **Testability** - Test with lightweight runtime, deploy with optimized one

```

### 🔸 Generated Bindings Examples (9 examples)

Using `wit-bindgen-wcl` for type-safe, ergonomic code:

```bash
# From workspace root
cargo run --example bindgen-calculator         # ✅ Calculator with logging & error handling
cargo run --example bindgen-web-scraper        # ✅ Web scraping component
cargo run --example bindgen-single-component   # ✅ Basic binding generation
